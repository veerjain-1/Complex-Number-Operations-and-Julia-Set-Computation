# Complex-Number-Operations-and-Julia-Set-Computation
This project provides a set of operations for complex numbers and includes a function to compute the Julia set. The operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, negation, inversion, dot product, and exponentiation of complex numbers. Additionally, the project contains functionality to compute the Julia set, which is a fractal pattern generated using complex number arithmetic.
